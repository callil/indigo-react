## Maintenance

A design system's evolution is inevitable as our products mature. We want to keep our design language consistent, but also have flexibility. When you want to make change to the system, your decisions fall into two choices: amending and inventing. I've laid out how to navigate both.


### I want to modify/amend an existing pattern. How do I do it?
1. Can you amend the existing pattern to support your requirements, while still supporting existing requirements?
2. Make the change via PR 'amend/[existing-pattern-name]'. Please highlight what the changes are and how it supports existing features.
3. If you amend it and it doesn't support existing requirements, this might be a new pattern

### I want to create a new pattern.

6. Can your new pattern be used in existing products/sites?
7. If not, then this is a unique component and will not be merged into the design system.
8. If so, make a PR 'new/[pattern-name]'. Highlight how this can be used in existing products/sites.
